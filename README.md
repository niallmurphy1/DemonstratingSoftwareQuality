## _What is Code Review?_
Code review is a software quality assurance activity where source code is viewed and assessed by one or several people. Code reviews occur when there is a completion of a software develeopment feature or as a safeguard in prevention of errors. At least one of the reviewers must not be the author of the code. Code review is a common practice adopted in software development to improve software code quality based on static code analysis by peers and automated reviewers. There are studies that provide evidence that it reduces the number of defects detected after release.
